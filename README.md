### How to transfer configurations
One feature of this software is to transfer your saved passwords to other systems.
1. Open the passwordmanager directory located in the Users folder on your system (On Windows it will be C:/Users/your_name/passwordmanager/). Linux may be /home/your_name/passwordmanager/
2. Zip the passwordmanager folder (or zip individual user folders if you only want to transfer one user)
3. On your new system, unzip the passwordmanager folder in your home user directory (C:/Users/your_name/ on Windows)
4. If you decided to zip only a user folder rather than the passwordmanager folder, then create a new folder called "passwordmanager" and unzip your user folder there.
