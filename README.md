### How to transfer configurations
One feature of this software is to transfer your saved passwords to other systems.
1. Open the passwordmanager directory located in the Users folder on your system (On Windows it will be C:/Users/your_name/passwordmanager/). Linux may be /home/your_name/passwordmanager/
2. Zip your user folder (there will be a folder with your created username) and either put it on USB or email it to yourself (the files inside are encrypted).
3. On your new system, unzip your user folder and create a directory called passwordmanager in your system's user folder (Windows: C:/Users/your_name/)
4. Paste your unzipped folder in the newly-created passwordmanager folder, which should now look like (C:/Users/your_name/passwordmanager/user_name)
